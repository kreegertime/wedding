        While we love kids, we're not able to accommodate all. In general, kids from these groups are invited: out-of-town guests and close family members. For local MN parents, we hope you consider it a night out with your significant other. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

        With the leaves starting to change colors, fall is a beautiful time in MN. The average high temperature for the beginning of October is in the lower 60's - perfect for spending some time outside or exploring downtown White Bear Lake. The average low temperature is in the mid 40's, so come prepared with layers. Also, be sure to check the forecast because MN weather can be wildly unpredictable.
